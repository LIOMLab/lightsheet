"""FrameSaverController — god-object split collaborator.

Owns the ``FrameSaver`` + ``FrameViewer`` QObject instances and routes the
shell's save/enqueue calls through to them. The QObjects themselves stay
defined in ``lightsheet/gui/controller.py`` (per PATTERNS.md — they
already have the right shape and are not re-engineered); this collaborator
just owns/routes to them.

This is a plain-Python object (NOT a ``QObject``) per the plain-Python collaborator pattern
1: collaborators emit through a shell reference, never declare their own
``pyqtSignal``, and never call ``.connect()``. The one exception is the
``FrameSaver.sig_status_message`` → ``shell.updateUi_message_printer``
connection, which is preserved verbatim from the pre-extraction
``hardware_init`` — ``FrameSaver`` runs its save worker on a thread and
its status messages must cross to the GUI thread via the signal/slot
queue (AGENTS.md §11). That connection is made on the owned ``FrameSaver``
instance, not on this collaborator.
